          <p className="py-2 leading-relaxed text-gray-800">We are a registered stud and have been breeding White Suffolk sheep since 1989.  With our White Suffolks we aim to produce a sheep that is industry leading in its length, size and growth rate while maintaining a good structure for easy lambing and durability. White Suffolks are know for producing prime trade and export lambs with the flexibility to produce premium early finishing sucker lambs or heavy weight lambs later on. They grow fast and keep on growing! Tight wool and clean points produce lambs that stay clean and sappy for longer and have good skin values.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 leading-relaxed text-gray-800">White Suffolks rams are hard working with good fertility and libido. They are ideal over first cross ewes and many of our clients are having great success over merinos, maidens and ewe lambs. They are a long living and durable breed which will likely give you many seasons of work so you are likely to get more bang for your buck.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 leading-relaxed text-gray-800">Another area White Suffolks are showing promise in is as a Maternal sire to produce commercial ewes and replacement ewes. White Suffolk x Merino ewes are proving to be a profitable option growing in popularity. White Suffolks are excellent milkers and mothers.  Their clean points, clean breach and tight wool will produce a hardy and high quality meat orientated cross bread ewe.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 leading-relaxed text-gray-800">Our White Suffolk Genetics are sourced from as far as South Australia, New South Wales and all around Victoria from some of the best studs in the country. We aim to keep a high standard within our flock and to produce rams that are at the highest national standard and to keep the breed improving. No effort or cost is spared when it comes to sourcing genetics.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 leading-relaxed text-gray-800">When it comes to type there are two clear types getting around with White Suffolk Sheep.  Big long upstanding rams and more compact meaty types.  We aim to produce both as one size does not fit all.
          </p>
          <p className="py-2 leading-relaxed text-gray-800">LAMBPLAN has not been our main focus as a stud as we believe visual traits are more important however a more direct focus on EBVS the last few seasons has seen a sharp rise in our stud's figures.  Our plan is to continue to increase our figures so that our rams give the buyers some of the best available ASBVs to chose from without regressing in visual traits.  Maintaining good birth weights, increasing PWT, EMD and TCP have already been achieved and will continue to increase in our stud.
